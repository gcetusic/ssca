models:

    1. replace Coordinates with Location but set person to null temporarily
        - be careful to set the correct max_digits (lat 7, lon 8)
        - use ranges -89--89 and -179--179

    2. modify random data generator to insert date and person in Location
        - don't use a function from inside the model to do that
        - print usage (optional since generated only once)

    3. export fixtures

    4. Person should be a profile of user?
        - it depends on what the admin interface should look like


views:

    1. set the zoom and center on first load of map
        - initial zoom?
        - initial center?

    2. one view for marker info and marker list - pass parameter for former

    3. compare clustering algorithms
        - which one is more efficient?
        - does scipy differently than Pycluster (more markers in center)?
        - numpy doesn't play well with virtualenv - this is a reported bug


javascript:

    1. close other popups when clicking on new ones

    2. move javascript to a separate static file

    3. implement markerClusterer
